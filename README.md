# IPL Chatbot

## 📌 Project Overview & Purpose

The **IPL Chatbot** is an interactive web-based chatbot designed to provide information, insights, and updates related to the Indian Premier League (IPL). It enables users to ask questions, receive responses, and engage in conversations around IPL matches, teams, and players in an intuitive interface. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the integration of conversational AI with a modern frontend stack, delivering an engaging fan experience.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Dependencies

### Frontend

* **React** – UI framework for building interactive components
* **Vite** – Fast bundler & development server
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
* **TypeScript** – Type safety for JavaScript

### Backend/Support

* **Python** – for running helper scripts (`start_dev.py`)
* **Node.js** – package management & runtime

### Dependencies

* Listed in `package.json` & `pnpm-lock.yaml` (examples include ESLint, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, etc.)

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd IPLChatbot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using **npm**:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using **pnpm** (if preferred):

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server, and the app will be accessible in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).

### 4. (Optional) Python Startup Script

If additional backend setup is needed, run:

```bash
python start_dev.py
```

## 🔄 Detailed Working Flow (Step by Step)

1. **Launch Application**
   Start the Vite dev server → Opens chatbot UI in browser.

2. **User Interaction**
   User enters a query related to IPL (e.g., “Who won IPL 2023?”).

3. **Chatbot Processing**

   * Input is passed through frontend components.
   * If integrated with backend/LLM (future scope), query is processed.
   * A response is generated (static/dynamic based on configuration).

4. **Response Display**
   The chatbot displays the answer in a conversational format.

5. **Repeat Interaction**
   User can continue the conversation seamlessly.
